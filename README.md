# Student_performance_in_Exam  
To understand the influence of the parents background, test preparation etc on students performance  
To know which factor may affect the student's performance, we classify the score into couple of ranks, and figure out which feature affects the score more significant. The independent variables are follow:  

1. gender : sex of students  
2. race/ethnicity : ethnicity of students  
3. parental level of education : parents' final education  
4. lunch : having lunch before test (normal or abnormal)  
5. test preparation course : complete or not complete before test
